# VR-Galaxies-Web-Tests
Web-based flythroughs vizualizing clusters of galaxies.

As of March 2021, some of these flythroughs can also be accessed at aggliu.github.io/GalaxyInteractives.

These flythroughs are experimental and not guaranteed to work.  In particular, the WebVR flythroughs suffer from performance issues on tested devices.
